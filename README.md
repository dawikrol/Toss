# Toss

It's my first Python project. 

In this project I wanted to practice my knowledge of OOP in Python and using SQL DataBase in practice.

Toss is really simple application that allows you to create shared shopping lists with other users.

After download use DB_scripts to create database in MySQL and change credentials in Model->DB. (I know that pass, keys shouldn't be keep in code but it's only learininh project)
